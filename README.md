# react-pong

An experimental version of the famous Pong game, built in React, and definitely over-engineered. It is fully responsive meaning that you can play on any sized screen (with sensibility), though performance may drop on very large displays. Recommended size is 1000x700, also because it looks the closest to the original game.
